# Search and Destroy

This gamemode has two teams. One is the defending team and the other is the attacking team. There are two bombsites (nodes), and one bomb. The attacking team is given the bomb at the start of the game. They must plant the bomb at one of the bomb sites before time is up. After planting, the defending team must defuse the bomb in order to win the round. Defenders also win if all attackers are dead before the bomb is planted. Attackers win only if the bomb detonates.
